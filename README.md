FlickIt!
========

FlickIt is an example game for Android and Desktop platforms written with the libGDX framework.

This is the current working version; the prior will be removed shortly. 
Major changes here are in the inrastructure. It has been converted to 
Gradle for the build, and now uses the latest version of libGDX.

The current version is available on Google Play:
